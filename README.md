# CoreImageTest
Two swift playground demonstrating CoreImage filter problems in El Capitan

This repository contains two swift playgrounds one for Xcode 6.4 and one for Xcode 7. The playground for Xcode 7 demonstrates that the use of CoreImages works as expected in El Capitan. The Xcode 6.4 playground that demonstrates the issue I was having with an application that used CoreImage filters built using Xcode 6.4 on Yosemite when the application was being run on El Capitan.
